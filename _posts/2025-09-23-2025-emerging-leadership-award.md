</h3>

The Emerging Leadership Award is established to honour and recognize early-to-mid-career (EMCR) researchers who have demonstrated exceptional independence, leadership, and a significant scientific contribution to the field of human brain mapping. This award aims to support researchers in advancing their careers while fostering innovation and collaboration within the scientific community.

    <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Eligibility Criteria
</h3>

1. Applicants must be within ten years of completing their doctoral degree (based on the date of the letter of completion, not conferral) as of 30 Sep 2025.
2. Candidates should show research independence, leadership, and a sustained record of scientific contributions in human brain mapping.
3. Applicants must be employed (at least 0.5 FTE) at a recognized research institution or university within Australia. Researchers who completed their PhD outside Australia but are currently based in Australia are also eligible.
4. Active membership in the Australian Chapter of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping is required. You can become a member for free by filling [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-7hOgdWB0sMSFNMZ73SJAOtrvaxEBjzg0EGiBoJorPyxWjg/viewform).

    <i class="fa-solid fa-users-viewfinder"></i> Emphasis on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
</h3>

The Chapter is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive research community. We strongly encourage applications from underrepresented groups in science, including women, ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ researchers, and those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The selection process will ensure fairness and inclusivity, evaluating candidates based on their scientific merit, leadership, and commitment to DEI principles.

Recognizing that personal circumstances such as parental leave, health issues, caregiving responsibilities, or other significant interruptions can impact a researcher’s career trajectory, such factors will be considered when assessing an applicant's achievements relative to opportunity. Applicants are encouraged to provide a statement explaining any career disruptions, detailing their duration and impact on research productivity.
